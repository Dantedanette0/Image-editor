**Creating a project README**

It looks like the user wants a README file for their image-processing app built with PySimpleGUI, PIL, OpenCV, and others. I’ll focus on the basics, covering project details, installation, dependencies, usage, features, and a license section, along with maybe a screenshot placeholder. This is straightforward! Since they didn’t specifically ask for a file or canvas, I’ll provide the README content directly in markdown form, so they can copy and use as needed.

Thought for a couple of seconds

Here’s a comprehensive **README.md** for your Image Processing App project. Feel free to tweak any section (e.g. add screenshots, change wording) as needed.

# Image Processing App

A desktop GUI application for interactive image manipulation and filters, built with Python, PySimpleGUI, OpenCV, Pillow, and Matplotlib.  

## Features

- **Basic Filters**  
  - Grayscale conversion  
  - Histogram equalization  
  - Averaging (box) blur  
  - Gaussian blur  
  - Contrast, saturation & color temperature adjustment via sliders  
- **Artistic “Painted” Look**  
  - Stroke-based effect using custom line‐drawing and edge detection  
- **Resize & Interpolation**  
  - Maintain aspect ratio or free sizing  
  - Nearest-neighbor & bilinear resizing algorithms  
- **Undo/Redo**  
  - Track every change; revert or reapply steps  
- **Histogram Overlay**  
  - Live “Before” vs “After” pixel-value histograms  
- **Settings Persistence**  
  - Save/load filter parameters to/from a YAML file  
- **Save Output**  
  - Export your final image to PNG (or other formats supported by Pillow)

## Demo

> _Insert your screenshots here_  
> - `before.png` vs `after.png` side-by-side  
> - Filter sliders and histogram pane  

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- The following packages (install via `pip`):

  ```bash
  pip install numpy opencv-python Pillow PySimpleGUI matplotlib pyyaml
````

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dantedanette0/Custom_gray_scale.git
   cd Custom_gray_scale
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   See **Requirements** above or:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Controls & Workflow**

   * **Open** an image with the file-browse dialog.
   * Adjust sliders for blur, contrast, saturation, temperature.
   * Click **Apply Filters**, **Grayscale**, **Histogram Equalize**, or **Apply Painted Look**.
   * Use **Undo** / **Redo** to navigate the history.
   * **Show/Hide Histogram** to toggle the overlay.
   * **Resize** to specify new dimensions and select interpolation.
   * **Save** exports the current “After” image.
   * **Save Settings** / **Load Settings** for your slider presets.

## File Structure

```
├── main.py                   # entry-point and GUI logic
├── utils/                    # helper modules (if any)
│   ├── image_ops.py          # filter & interpolation functions
│   └── settings.py           # YAML save/load
├── requirements.txt          # pip dependencies
└── README.md                 # this document
```

> If you keep everything in one file, just adjust paths above.

## Customization

* **Add more filters** by editing or extending:

  * `adjust_saturation`
  * `apply_contrast`
  * `detect_edges` & `draw_strokes` for new artistic effects
* **Swap GUI toolkit**: port from PySimpleGUI to Qt, Tkinter, etc.
